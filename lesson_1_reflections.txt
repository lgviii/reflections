How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The diff allowed me to narrow down the possible loctions of the
error that was introducted.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It could allow me to revert to specific time stamp, or help me
to remember the reasoning behind modifications.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one 
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Non-code version control systems may not have related context.

// copy the whole repository to a local space
git clone URL

// see commits
git log
// use q to exit log

// get the diff between files
get diff revisiona revisionb

i.e.
git diff df035382c41b4d0cda86a1aa30b53f15bef05b53 b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6

// How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
above.

//checking out a commit is getting a copy of a version
git checkout 25ede836903881848fea811df5b687b59d962da3

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I'm very confident with git, since I can easily identify exactly where my
changes break the product...

// Turn a directory into a new git directory
git init
